Surrogate analysis
------------------
This example shows how to estimate a significance threshold in a comodulogram.

A comodulogram shows the estimated PAC metric on a grid of frequency bands.
In absence of PAC, a PAC metric will return values close to zero, but not
exactly zero. To estimate if a value is significantly far from zero, we use a
surrogate analysis.

In a surrogate analysis, we recompute the comodulogram many times, adding each
time a random time shift to remove any possible coupling between the
components. Nota that these time shifts have to be far from zero to effectively
remove a potential coupling. These comodulograms give us an estimation of the
fluctuation of the metric in the absence of PAC.

To derive a significance level from the list of comodulograms, we discuss here
two different methods:
- Computing a z-score on each couple of frequency, and thresholding at z = 4.
- Computing a threshold at a given p-value, over a distribution of comodulogram
maxima.

# adding the `n_surrogates` parameter.

# Then we plot the significance level on top of the comodulogram.
# Here we present two methods.
#
# The z-score method presented here considers independently each pair of
# frequency of the comodulogram. For each pair, we compute the mean `mu` and
# standard deviation `sigma` of the PAC values computed over the surrogates
# signals. We then transform the original PAC values `PAC` (non time-shifted)
# into z-scores `Z`: Z = (PAC - mu) / sigma
#
# This procedure, used for example in [Canolty et al, 2006], suffers from
# multiple-testing issues, and also assumes that the distribution of PAC values
# is Gaussian.
#
#
# The other method presented here considers the ditribution of comodulogram
# maxima. For each surrogate comodulogram, we compute the maximum PAC value.
# From the obtained empirical distribution of maxima, we compute the
# 95-percentile, which corresponds to a p-value of 0.05.
#
# This method does not assume the distribution to be Gaussian, nor suffers from
# multiple-testing issues. This is the default method in the `plot` method.
