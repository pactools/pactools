This package provides tools to estimate **phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)**
in neural time series.

In particular, it implements the **driven auto-regressive (DAR)**
models presented in the reference below [`Dupre la Tour et al. 2017`_].

Read more in the `documentation <https://pactools.github.io>`_.

Installation
============

To install ``pactools``, you first need to install its dependencies::

	pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn

To enable all features, you will also need to install optional packages::

    pip install mne h5py

Then install ``pactools``::

	pip install git+https://github.com/pactools/pactools.git#egg=pactools

To upgrade, use the ``--upgrade`` flag provided by ``pip``.

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

	python -c 'import pactools'

and it should not give any error messages.

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)
==============================
Among the different classes of cross-frequency couplings,
phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) - i.e. high frequency activity time-locked
to a specific phase of slow frequency oscillations - is by far the most
acknowledged.
PAC is typically represented with a comodulogram, which shows the strenght of
the coupling over a grid of frequencies.
Comodulograms can be computed in `pactools` with more
than 10 different methods.

Driven auto-regressive (DAR) models
===================================
One of the method is based on driven auto-regressive (DAR) models.
As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the
pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform
on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a
score of the model **goodness of fit** via the likelihood, enabling easy
and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison;
this data-driven feature is unique to such model-based approach.

We recommend using DAR models to estimate PAC in neural time-series.
